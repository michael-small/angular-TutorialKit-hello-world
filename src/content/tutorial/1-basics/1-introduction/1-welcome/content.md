# Welcome to TutorialKit

Hey there, and welcome to TutorialKit ðŸ‘‹!

To kick things off, we have prepared a small demo lesson for you, where we'll dive into the concept of event handling in JavaScript. Our task is to resuscitate a lifeless counter app by introducing the crucial element of interactivity: **event listeners**.

Let's look at the preview on the right for a moment and try to click on the button that says `counter is 0`. We'll notice that it doesn't work.


Event listeners are essential in web development as they enable our applications to respond to user actions. In this case, we need to listen for clicks on the button to increment the counter.

To address this, we'll call the `addEventListener` to attach a `click` event listener to the button element. When a click is detected, we'll execute a callback function that increments the counter and updates the `innerHTML` accordingly.



This gives you a sneak peak of the TutorialKit experience, demonstrating what it's capable of.

Happy writing!
